In November 2023, while working out, I fell and fractured my knee. I had only read about how intense a knee injury could be, but experiencing it myself was a challenge. This was a difficult phase for me. In January, I started walking slowly, using ice packs, and doing exercises religiously. At first, I doubted I would ever walk again, but I did. Then, in February, I ran 100 meters for the first time since the injury. Slowly and carefully, I resumed working out and running. 

It was my first marathon, and Iâ€™m proud to say that I completed it in under 2 hours, starting from the C lineup. A big thanks to Sagar for guiding me through this journey and to Dr. Sandeep Kate for his book 'M - Marathoncha,' which taught me almost everything about marathons, especially the training part, which was really helpful.
